# AlbumMan

AlbumMan (Album Manager) is a tool I'm developing to help assist me in the process of selecting, captioning and tagging photos for my transport and infrastructure gallery over at gallery.nxk.io. As the gallery itself is statically generated, this tool outputs YAML metadata files which will be later consumed by the static site generator.

AlbumMan is a .NET Framework/WinForms app written in C#.
